## Features

- **Switchable Profile Avatar:** Rotate through different custom profile images by clicking the avatar frame directly or the quick rotate trigger icon.
- **Search Command Palette (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`):** Dynamic keyboard-accessible command menu with shortcuts to jump directly to page sections, external socials, or toggle themes.
- **Interactive GitHub Contributions Matrix:** Asynchronous heatmap fetching live contribution levels directly from the GitHub API using a custom React hook, displayed in a responsive 7-row calendar grid.
- **Fading Quotes Rotator:** An interactive inspiration panel in the footer cycling through selected quotes (Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Luffy, Naruto, Zuckerberg) with custom fading transitions.
- **Pixel Cat Cursor Follower:** Interactive classic `oneko.js` pixel cat that follows the user's cursor across the screen, complete with automatic cleanup and nested route loading support.
- **Konami Code Easter Egg:** Listening for classic trigger keys ("zaid", "hasan", or the classic Konami sequence) to activate interactive falling confetti achievements.
- **Writing / Blog Integration:** Centered grid writing section displaying technical essays and system architecture reviews synced directly to Medium.
